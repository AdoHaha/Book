    "\n",
    "Topic, Service and Parameter are the workhorses of ROS. Each simplifies some particular type of communication inside ROS so that your robots can do stuff efficientely.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short:\n",
    "**Topic** is used when we don't care who writes the message and who reads the message as long as it is on the right topic and of the right format (i.e. What is the **/temperature** outside, asks someone. It is 5 **degrees Celcius** answers someone) \n",
    "\n",
    "**Service** is a different format, where we ask for some calculation or action and receive response **in return**.\n",
    "I.e. (I ask Please switch off the light /intelligent_light and I receive response OK)\n",
    "Both command and response needs to be in a format that we agreed upon. Also, there can be only one agent with a particular service. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameter** is a common database of parameters that can be read or written to by ROS actors. Such parameters may be the hardware configuration, robot description or some other settings. Usually they are read by a node when inicializing\n"

This is because the messages can be very different and actually have a whole structure inside. \n",

As robots have multiple parts, connected using joints it is usually good to know how these joints are set. This can be used for example, to visualize robot. The message has also a **header** that is a form of a timestamp that gives us information when the message was sent. This is usefull to, for example, use only the newest messages or even debug the communication if the header is strange or very old."
