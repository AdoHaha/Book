Form and size:
---
  * Article should contain short abstract at the beginning (4-6 sentences recommended).
  * Main part of the article can have various forms, depending on what author will find the most suitable,
  for example it can be strictly aligned with what he wants to pass to attendees during the talk/workshop or it can be
  a supplement of the topic. Also it can contain elements that don't present well or are to fit on slides - for example
  bigger chunks of code.
  * Article should contain between 800 and 2500 characters. In case of longer articles we reserve the right to cut some
  less important parts (with author's agreement)
  * At the end of article please provide the sources, that were used while writing the article (some where used for sure!).
  You can also recommend to reader some websites and books related to the topic.
  * In case of links more general form is prefered (address of the main website + title of source article)
  For example:
  pythonabc.eu "How to create Pong using Python"
  instead of
  pythonabc.eu/index.php?opt=com_sasd&art=243523&id=2&Itemid=13
