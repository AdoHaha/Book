# Tornado and Friends workshop - Wesley Mason

## Learn how to write fast asynchronous web services with Tornado and Python

The world isn't blocking; why should your app be?

Asynchronous - *non-blocking* - I/O is a form of input/output processing that permits other processing to continue before the transmission has finished.

It's a technique that can help bypass bottlenecks in program operation, and vastly improve performance of software.

Tornado is an asynchronous networking library that can handle tens of thousands of open connections, and can readily be deployed alongside Django and other Python applications.

## Workshop goals

 * Create your first Tornado app
 * Integrate it with thirdparty libraries
 * Decide where and when to use Tornado and its components
 * Make a kitten smile (*subject to availability of kitten*)

## Prerequisites

 * A laptop (or desktop, but I'm not helping carry it.)
 * Working knowledge of Python (somewhere just above **Hello World!**)
 * Conversational English, or someone to translate, as I suck at Polskie.
